CAREER GOALS & INTERESTS:
- Seeking Summer 2026 Software Engineering Internship
- Specializing in front-end development and user-centered design
- Passionate about integrating AI technologies into web applications
- Interested in building responsive web applications with React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Tailwind
- Focused on creating inclusive digital experiences and solving meaningful problems
- Strong interest in cross-functional collaboration and applying technical expertise to impactful projects

UNIQUE BACKGROUND & TRANSITION STORY:
- Successfully transitioned from product management in Taiwan's interpretation industry to full-stack development
- The transition was driven by a desire to directly impact user experiences through technology rather than just managing projects
- During her time at Taiwan Chingu, she discovered her passion for frontend development while collaborating with engineers
- This hands-on experience with React and JavaScript sparked her decision to pursue formal computer science education
- Her language background (Mandarin, Korean, English) gives her unique insights into building inclusive, globally-accessible interfaces
- She understands both the business side (from product management) and technical implementation, making her an effective bridge between teams
- Her interpretation experience taught her to think critically about communication, which translates to creating clear, intuitive user interfaces
- Passionate about using technology to connect and empower communities, especially in multilingual contexts
- Holistic understanding of both technical implementation and user needs, with empathy for diverse user groups

CORE BELIEFS & PHILOSOPHY:
1. Empathy-Driven Design: Great products start with empathy. Understanding users' needs, frustrations, and goals is the foundation of meaningful design and development. Lily learned this through her interpretation work, where understanding context and cultural nuances was crucial for effective communication.

2. Purposeful Design: Design is not just how it looks, but how it works. Every pixel, interaction, and flow should serve a clear purpose and improve the user's experience. This philosophy stems from her product management background where she learned to prioritize user value over aesthetic appeal.

3. Inclusive Technology: Technology should empower, not intimidate. Building interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and inclusive for all users. Her multilingual background and experience with diverse user groups (including senior users at Racing Pigeon Alliance) has shaped this belief.

4. Continuous Learning: Learning never stops. Staying curious and adapting to new technologies, AI innovations, and UX best practices keeps work relevant and impactful. Her career transition from interpretation to software engineering exemplifies this commitment to growth.

5. Collaborative Innovation: Collaboration fuels innovation. Working closely with cross-functional teams leads to solutions that are stronger than any one person could create alone. Her experience bridging product and engineering teams at Taiwan Chingu reinforced this belief.

6. Creative Logic: Creativity and logic can coexist. The best front-end experiences come from balancing technical precision with imaginative thinking. Her background in language and literature brings creative problem-solving to technical challenges.

7. Attention to Detail: Small details make a big difference. From micro-interactions to performance optimizations, thoughtful craftsmanship creates delightful experiences. This attention to detail was honed through her interpretation work where precision in communication was essential.

8. Cultural Diversity: Diversity of language and culture enriches problem-solving. Fluency in Mandarin, Korean, and English allows bridging perspectives in global teams. This multilingual ability helps her design interfaces that work well across different cultural contexts.

LEARNING JOURNEY & GROWTH:
- Self-taught React and JavaScript while working at Taiwan Chingu, then pursued formal education to deepen technical knowledge
- Completed intensive programming certifications at UC Santa Cruz before starting master's program at Northeastern
- Constantly exploring new technologies, particularly AI integration tools and modern frontend frameworks
- Active in online developer communities and follows industry best practices for accessibility and performance
